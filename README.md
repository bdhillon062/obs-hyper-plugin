==============

[Hyper Online](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyper-vtuber-avatar-studio/id1535709341) is a VTuber content creation platform and social network, currently on iOS. Build a VTuber or import an avatar and use it to record content, live-stream, and chat right on your phone.

If you'd like to use Hyper Online with your desktop setup, this plugin pairs with the Hyper Online app and mirrors your Hyper Avatar into the popular live-streaming software OBS (Open Broadcaster Software). This can then be used for professional VTuber live-streams on Twitch, avatar Discord calls, Zoom meetings, and more.
